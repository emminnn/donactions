#Donactions

##Overview

This is a project that was supposed to be initially developed collectively with Stockholm Meteor Meetup group. But then individually done by me.

It's a hybrid web-app that is based on the idea that donation as a concept could also be based on a certain action needs to be taken there and now, with a well-defined context, aim and pragmatic goals, by any people who can somehow register their authenticity. Besides donation receivers worldwide should be more transparent, and informative to their donors in this age of information about the resources (donation) they receive and what they do with it. It's the basic right for individuals and groups to attain feedback on what their donations have been spent on.

The app is based on Meteor and React. Open to contributions.
